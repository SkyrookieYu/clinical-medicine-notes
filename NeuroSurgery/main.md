# Surgical Anatomy of the brain
## Arterial Relationships
1. Middle cerebral artery (MCA)
    - Sphenoidal segment (M1): internal carotid artery (ICA) to limen insulae
    - Insular segment (M2): limen insulae to superior and inferior circular sulcus of the insula
    - Opercular segment (M3): runs in opercular compartment
    - Cortical segment (M4): sylvian fissure to the lateral surface of the cerebrum
    - Sylvian point (M point): loop of the most posterior M3 segment branch that exits from the sylvian fissure

1. Posterior cerebral artery (PCA)
    - P1: Basilar bifurcation to the site where PCom joins the PCA
    - P2: PCom to the posterior aspect of the midbrain
        - P2A: begins at the PCom and courses around the crus cerebri, inferior to optic tract
        - P2P: posterior margin of the crus cerebri to tegmentum of the midbrain within the ambient cistern
    - P3: under the posterior part of the pulvinar in the lateral aspect of the quadrigeminal cistern to the anterior limit of the anterior calcarine sulcus
        - The calcarine artery
        - The pareto-occipital artery
    - P4: cortical branches of the PCA

1. Anterior cerebral artery (ACA)
    - A1: bifurcation of the ICA to ACom
    - A2: ACom to the junction between rostrum and the genu of the cornus callosum
    - A3: the genu of the cornus callosum to the point where artery turns sharply
    - A4, A5: extend from the genu to the splenium

1. Medial surface
    - Inner layer: corpus callosum
    - Intermediate layer: Cingulate gyrus
    - Outer layer
        - Paracentral lobule
        - Paracentral ramus
        - Paracentral lobule
            - voluntary control of contralateral lower limb and perineal region
            - defecation and micturition
        - Marginal ramus

1. Brainstem
    - Midbrain
        - Anterior: the crus cerebri (or basis pedunculi)
        - Intermediate: the tegmentum
        - Posterior: the tectum
    - Pons (protuberance) groove
    - Medulla

# Cerebral Edema
1. Classifications
    - cytotoxic: secondary to cell injury
    - vasogenic: vascular leakage through a disrupted BBB
    - interstitial: secondary to hydrocephalus
    - osmotic

1. MRI representations
    - vasogenic edema
        - T1: Hypodense
        - T2, FLAIR: dexamethasone
    - cytotoxic edema
        - ~ 12 hrs: Loss of visible gray-white junction and gyral edema
        - 12 ~ 24 hrs: hyperintensity in T2
        - Sensitive to DWI: hyperintense
        - Acute infarction: low ADC

1. Treatment
    - diversion of spinal fluid: interstitial edema
    - reverse the cause: cytotoxic, interstitial and ostomic edema
    - glucocorticoids
        - improve symptoms in vasogenic edema esp. patients with brain tumors
    - diuretics: limited effect in time and efficacy
    - carbonic anhydrase inhibitor acetazolamide: decreases CSF production: modest efficacy
    - osmotic agents: a temporary measure to provide time for the initiation for definitive treatment to eliminate the cause
    - mannitol or hypertonic saline: vasoconstriction, enhanced cerebral blood flow, altered rheology, alter the content of edema


# Physiology of the Cerebrospinal Fluid and Intracranial Pressure
Notes: 1 mmHg = 13.6 mmHâ‚‚O

1. Usual range: 5 - 10 mmHg, upper limit of 15 mmHg

1. Signs of elevated ICP
    - Vomiting without associated nausea
    - Papilledema: good specificity, observer dependent sensitivity
    - The Cushing Reflex
        - Arterial hypertension: Pressure on the brainstem
        - Bradycardia: Pressure on vagus nerve
    - Respiration abnormality
        - Cheyne-Stokes respiration: Damage to the diencephalic region
        - Sustained hyperventilation: Dysfunction of the midbrain and upper pons
        - Ataxic respiration: Pontomedullary lesions
    - Herniation

1. Guidelines for ICP monitoring
    - GCS score of 3 to 8 + Abnormal CT
    - GCS score of 3 to 8 + Normal CT: 2 or more
        - Age: over 40 y/o
        - Unilateral Motor posturing
        - Systolic BP below 90 mmHg
    - GCS score of greater than 8 + Significant mass lesions in CT

1. Intracranial Pressure management
    - CSF
        - Ventriculostomy
        - Ventriculosubgaleal shunt
        - Ventriculoperitoneal shunt
        - Ventriculoatrial shunt
        - Third ventriculostomy
        - Meditations
            - Acetazolamide
                - most frequently used
                - has vasodilator effect, which may transiently worsen intracranial hypertension
                - **contraindicated in patients with closed head injury**
            - Furosemide
            - Corticosteroids
    - Blood: Reduce Cerebral Blood Volume (CBV)
        - Moderate hyperventilation (32 - 35 torr), tapered when discontinued
        - Elevation of the head (30 - 60 deg.), without rotation of the head or flexion of the neck
        - Increasing the clearance of edema
        - Hypothermia
    - Other: removal

1. Drugs
    - Steroids
        - Treatment of edema with brain tumors
        - No definite benefits seen in patients with head injury
        - Worsen outcome in cerebral ischemia
    - Barbiturates: pentobarbital is more effective
        - Appropriate for patients in whom conventional measures to control ICP have failed
        - Effective in situations where Cerebral Blood Flow (CBF) is greater than metabolism
        - Usage
            - pentobarbital 5 - 10 mg/kg in 30 minutes
            - followed by continuous hourly maintenance infusion of 1 - 5 mg/kg
            - if hypotension occurs, apply volume expansion and dopamine anticonvulsant
    - Osmotic diuretics
        - Widely used to treat both vasogenic and cytotoxic edema
        - Transiently increase CBF independent of effect on ICP
        - **maybe contraindicated in patients with hyperemia and increased CBV**
    - Mannitol (20% Solution)
        - Rapid effect on ICP
        - Dose: 250 - 1000 mg/kg
    - Loop diuretics
        - Often used in conjunction with mannitol
        - Most appropriate in patients with fluid overload
        - Do not contribute greatly to lowering of ICP in the acute setting

# Altered Consciousness
1. Coma

1. Vegetative State (VS): caused by loss of thalamic neurons, esp. those in central thalamic intralaminar nueclei.

1. Minimally Conscious State (MCS)

   The only behavioral evidence of responsiveness is consistent and sustained visual tracking or fixation.
   Other behaviors are similar to VS.

   Diagnosis

   - Simple command following
   - Gestural or verbal "yes/no" responses
   - Intelligible verbalization
   - Purposefule behavior

1. Akinetic Mutism (AM)

   Syndromes include that of MCS and severe reduction in spontaneous behavior or extremely slowed interactive responses.

   Associated with:

   - bilateral damage to the anterior medial regions of the cerebral cortex
   - bilateral damage to caudate nuclei
   - bilateral central thalamic lesions
   - large baseal forebrain injuries
   - damage to the mesencephalic reticular formation

   Can be caused by Acom aneurysm rupture

1. Prognosis <!-- TODO: yet to be studied -->

   Comatose patients suffering traumatic brain injury have a significantly hihger likelihood of recovery than do comatose patients after cardiac arrest.

   VS patients 3 months after cardiac arrest or loss of blood flow is considered to be in a permanent VS.
   Posttraumatic VS remaining for 1 year is considered permanent.

   In MCS, significant further recovery may occur in some patients after 1 year.
