## Lumbar Puncture

Risk of Lumbar Puncture (LP)

- High
    - Papilledema resulting from intracranial mass
    - Asymmetric lesions, esp. near the tentorium or foramen magnum

- Considerably Low
    - SAH
    - Hydrocephalus with communication between all the ventricles
    - Pseudo-tumor cerebri

## Examination of CSF
1. Pressure
    - 100 - 180 mmH₂O
    - 8 - 14 mmHg

1. Color

    - erythrochromia: (supernatant fluid) pink-red, observed a few hours after RBCs begin to hemolyze in SAH.

    - xanthochromia: (supernatant fluid) yellow-brown
        - More than a day after RBCs begin to hemolyze in SAH. (RBC > 100,000 /mm³, with contamination of bilirubin and lipochromes).
        - Jaundice
        - Elevation of CSF protein (Albumin > 150 mg/100ml, due to albumin-bound fraction of bilirubin)
        - Hypercarotenemia
        - Hyperglobinemia

1. Cellularity: Fewer than 5 lymphocytes or other mononuclear cells per cubic millimeter
    - Elevation of WBC
        - Inflammation (infectious or immunologic)
        - Hemorrhage
        - Chemical substances
        - Neoplasm
        - Vasculitis
    - Elevation of eosinophilic leukocytes
        - Parasitic infections
        - Hodgkin disease
        - Neurosyphilis
        - Cholesterol emboli

1. Protein: 45 - 50 mg/dL in basal cisterns (or 5 - 15 in ventricles)
    - Obscure: &lt; 75 mg/dL
    - Spillage: 1mg increase of protein per 1,000 RBCs
    - SAH: many times the ratio of spillage, for the irritating effect of RBC upon the leptomeninges
    - Bacterial meningitis: > 500 mg/dL
    - Viral infections: 50 - 100 mg/dL but sometimes can be normal or up to 200 mg/dL
    - Paraventricular tumors: > 100 mg/dL
    - Guillain-Barré syndrome: Elevation of protein level while cell count remains normal. Can be greater than 500 mg/dL
    - Block to CSF flow: (Frobin syndrome) > 1,000 mg/dL, with xanthochromia and clots readily
    - Partial CSF block: 100 - 200 mg/dL, by ruptured discs or tumor
    - Meningismus: low protein values (febrile illness with signs of meningeal irritation but normal CSF)

    Low CSF protein values are observed in meningismus, hyperthyroidism, or in conditions that produce low CSF pressure.

1. Glucose: 45 - 80 mg/dL, about ⅔ of that in the blood

   CSF glucose reduce in bacterial meningitis probably due to impairment of the membrane transfer system

    - Abnormal low CSF glucose with pleocytosys
        - bacterial meningitis
        - tuberculous
        - fungal meningitis
    - Abnormal low CSF glucose without pleocytosys
        - Widespread neoplastic infiltration of meninges
        - Sarcoidosis
        - SAH (usually in the 1st week)
        - Chemically induced inflammation

## Electroencephalography

1. Normal waves
    - α wave: slightly assymetrical 8- to 12-per-second 50-mV sinusoidal wave
    - β wave: 10 to 20 mV waves with freq faster than 12 Hz, usually observed with administration of benzodiazepines or other sedating drugs
    - θ wave: 4- to 7-Hz wave, often observed in temporal regions in persons older than 60 y/o.
    - δ wave: 1- to 3-Hz wave with ampllitudes from 50 to 350 mV. Dorminant rhythms in infants. Not present in normal adults.

1. Abnormal waves
    - breech rhythm: fast frontal β activity reflecting sedative drugs or skull defect if focal
    - spikes or sharp waves: transient high-voltage waveforms, usually seen as epileptiform discharges
    - electrocerebral silence: absense of EEG activity, which indicates brain death (or technical fault). Also transiently seen after admission of barbiturates.
    - isoelectric over all parts of the head
        - profound cerebral hypoxia or ischemia
        - raised ICP

1. Different conditions causing abnormal recordings
    - epilepsy
    - focal brain lesions: usually focal δ waves
        - bilateral synchronous: large lesions of diencephalon or mibrain
        - near-normal pattern: pons and medulla lesions
    - **herpes simplex encephalitis**: (characteristic) periodic high voltage sharp waves and slow-wave complexes of 1- to 3-Hz in the temporal regions
    - coma related diseases
        - burst suppression: brief isoelectric periods followed by high-voltage sharp and irregular δ activity, usually progressing to electrocerebral silence.
        - **hepatic coma**: (characteristic) triphasic waves
    - severe hypothyroidism: normal wave with decreased amplitude and frequency.
    - diffuse degenerative diseases
    - **SSPE**, **Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD)** or **cerebral lipidoses**: (characteristic) periodic bursts of high amplitude sharp waves
    - optic nerval diseases: absense of pattern-shift visual evoked responses (PSVERs)
    - lesions of VIII: prolongation of brainstem auditory evoked potentials (BAEPs, pp.49)

1. potentials available to be detected
    - pattern-shift visual evoked responses (PSVERs)
    - endogenous event-related evoked potentials
    - magnetic stimulation of the motor system
    - brainstem auditory evoked potentials
    - somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEP)

Most hysteria, catatonia, or schizophrenia patients as well as those with demyelinating diseases have normal EEG activity.

# Disorder of Motility
## Motor Paralysis

1. Motor neurons
    - α: large motor neurons of the anterior horn
        - forming disynaptic reflex
        - innervation
            - medial part: trunk or axial muscles
            - lateral part: appendicular muscles
    - β: effect concontraction of both spindle and non-spindle cells
    - γ: small anterior horn cells
        - keep intrafusal muscle fibers taut
        - innervation: small muscles (delicate movements)

1. Lesion Positioning
    - lower motor neurons: flaccidity and areflexia
        - pronounced atrophy ( ~ 70% )
        - flaccidity and hypotonia of affected muscles with loss of tendon reflexes
        - normal plantar reflex
        - fasciculations present sometimes
        - abnormal nerve conduction studies: denervation potentials in EMG
        - with sensory changes: both ant. and post. roots
        - without sensory changes: ant. gray matter of spinal cord, ant. roots, or a pure motor branch of peripheral nerve
    - upper motor neurons
        - affecting a group of muscles, never individual
        - atrophy slight and the result of disuse
        - spasticity with hyperactivity of the tendon reflexes and extensor plantar reflex aka. Babinski sign (release of flexor reflexes)
        - abolished cutaneous reflexes
        - fasciculations absent
        - normal nerve conduction studies
    - parietal lobe
        - Romberg's sign
        - diminishing speed of tapping

1. Points
    - pure pyramidal tract lesion does not result in spasticity

1. motor pathways
    - direct: pyramidal tract
    - indirect: rubrospinal, reticulospinal, vestibulospinal and tectospinal tract

1. hypertonia
    - velocity dependent: clasp-knife phenomenon
        - cerebral hemiplegia: clasp-knife relaxation following peak resistance
    - velocity independent
        - basal ganglia lesion: rigidity

1. apraxia
    - ideational: fail to conceive or formulate an action to command
    - ideomotor: fail to execute an action with either hand
    - limb-kinetic: fail to fluidly connect or to isolate individual movements of the hand and arm

### Physiology of CSF

1. CSF functions
    - water jacket for protecting its contents from injurious blows
    - make the brain floating
    - remove waste products of cerebral metabolism (as is done by lymphatic channels in the body)
    - preserve stable chemical environment for cells inside

1. Constants (for adults)
    - average intracranial volume: 1700 mL
        - brain: 1200-1400 mL
        - CSF: 70-160 mL
            - spinal subarachnoid space: 10-25 mL
        - blood: 150 mL
    - CSF formation rate: 21-22 mL/h or 500 mL/d

1. CSF circulation
    - formation site: mainly choroid plexuses (lateral ventricles)
    - forth ventricle
        - foramina of Magendie
        - foramina of Luschka
    - absorption site: arachnoid villi (sup. sagittal sinus)
    - affecting factors
        - increased ATP
        - (limited effect) arterial BP
        - increased venous BP
            - increased intrathoracic pressure
            - greatly elevated central/jugular venous pressure (beyond venous valves' ability)
            - mediastinal tumors
        - acidification of CSF e.g. inhalation or retention of CO₂
