# Atrial and ventricular enlargement
Echocardiogram is more accurate than ECG in diagnosis of cardiac enlargement.

1. Normal P wave
    - Width: less than 0.12 ms
    - Height: less than 0.25 mV

1. Right atrial abnomality (RAA)
    - Representation: Tall, narrow P wave, typical in II, III, aVF (P pulmonale pattern)
    - Cause: Right ventricular enlargement

1. Left atrial abnomality (LAA)
    - Representation: Prolonged P wave, typical in V1 (as left atrium depolarizes after right atrium)
        - P mitrale pattern
        - wide biphasic P wave, with negative component larger than 0.04 sec Ã— 0.1 mV
    - Causes
        - Coronary artery disease
        - left atrium enlargement
            - Aortic or mitral disease (stenosis or regurgitation)
            - Hypertensive heart disease
            - Cardiomyopathies
    - Indication: Increased risk of atrial fibrillation

1. Right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH)
    - Representation
        - Tall right precordial R waves (taller than S), typical in V1
        - Right axis deviation (RAD)
        - Right precordial T wave inversions (normal sequence of repolarization altered for unknown reason).
        - Right atrial enlargment: Peak P waves in II, III, V1
        - Right ventricular overload: ST segment depression
    - Causes
        - Atrial septal defect
        - Pulmonary artery hypertension
    - Exceptions
        - RVH associated with acute pulmonary embolism: Inverted T wave but no other signs only
        - RVH associated with emphysema: slow R wave progression with low voltage QRS complexes

1. Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH)
    - Representation
        - High R waves (see guideline criterias)
        - Repolarization abnomalities: slight ST segment depression with T wave inversion after a tall R wave
        - Left axis deviation
        - RBBB
        - LAA
    - Guideline criterias
        - $S_{V1}$ + $R_{V5}$ or $R_{V6}$ > 35 mm (not specific. also in atheletic or thin young adults)
        - $S_{V3}$ + $R_{aVL}$ > 28 mm (men) or 20 mm (women)
        - $R_{avL}$ > 11 mm

        - Aortic regurgitation
        - Mitral regurgitation
        - Dilated cardiomyopathy
        - Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy

# Ventricular conduction disturbances
1. Normal QRS complex
    - depolarization of interventricular septal: `r` in V1 and `q` in V6
    - depolarization of ventricle: Usually towards V3, V4

1. Right bundle branch block (RBBB)
    - Representation
        - rSR' in V1 with a wide R' wave
        - qRS in V6 with a wide S wave
        - Secondary T wave inversions: inverted right precordial T wave
        - LAA
    - Subdivision
        - Complete RBBB: QRS segment &ge; 0.12 sec in V1 or V6
        - Incomplete RBBB: QRS segment in 0.1 to 0.12 sec in V1 or V6
    - Causes
        - Isolated ECG abnomality (no clinical significance)
        - Organic heart disease
            - Left-to-right shunting of blood
            - Pulmonary artery hypertension
            - Valvular lesions
            - Cardiomyopathy
            - Coronary disease
        - Chronic degenerative changes in the conduction system
        - Pulmonary embolism: caused by sinus tachycardia

1. Left bundle branch block (LBBB)
    - Representation
        - Loss of r in V1 and q in V6
        - Prolonged QRS complex with slight notching at the peak
        - Secondary T wave inversions: inverted left precordial T wave
    - Subdivision
        - Complete LBBB: QRS segment &ge; 0.12 sec in V1 or V6
        - Incomplete LBBB: QRS segment in 0.1 to 0.12 sec in V1 or V6
    - Causes
        - Advanced coronary artery disease
        - Valvular heart disease
        - Hypertensive heart disease
        - Cardiomyopathy

1. Differential diagnosis of bundle branch blocks
    - Pacemaker rhythms
        - Right ventricular pacing is similar to LBBB
        - Biventricular pacing is similar to RBBB
    - LVH is similar to LBBB, but LVH often progresses to LBBB
    - Ventricular preexcitation syndrome (delta wave)
    - Ventricular arrhythmia

1. Left posterior fascicular block (LPFB)
    - Representation: RAD

1. Bifascicular block
    - Representation: RBBB with LAFB or LPFB
    - Significance: Acute bifascicular block may result in trifascicular block which develops complete heart block abruptly
    - Treatment: pacemakers

1. Trifascicular block
    - Representation: alternating bundle branch block
    - Treatment: permanent pacemakers

# Myocardial infarction and ischemia

    - ST depressions with prominent U waves
    - Prolonged repolarization

1. Hypocalcemia: Prolonged QT inteval with stretched ST segment
1. Hypercalcemia: Decrease of QT inteval with short ST segment
